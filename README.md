Fetch and Display Data from a Public API Using Fetch API.

This project demonstrates how to fetch and display user information from a public API using JavaScript's Fetch API. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and tested using tools like VS Code and the Chrome browser. The goal is to help beginners understand how to work with asynchronous JavaScript, consume RESTful APIs, and manipulate the DOM dynamically. The application fetches data from the public endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users, parses the JSON response, and displays user details such as name, email, and address inside styled cards on the webpage. A "Reload Data" button is included to re-fetch data without reloading the page, and all error handling is managed with a .catch() block, showing appropriate messages if something goes wrongâ€”such as during a network failure. The project includes a visually pleasant design with gradient backgrounds and hover effects, making the user interface clean and modern. This small yet powerful application helps reinforce key concepts like fetch, promise chaining, JSON handling, error management, and UI updates
